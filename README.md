# GEOINT
A collection of interesting GEOINT tools for daily use. As always no guarantee of availability! Feel free to contribute and commit! :)

# Collection ToDo's
- [x] creating a GEOINT repo
- [ ] setting the headings for the list
- [ ] adding all the tools with the urls
- [ ] adding some short comments
- [ ] verifying the collection and tick this todo :shipit:

# What is GEOINT?

- GEOINT, or Geospatial Intelligence, is the use of imagery, mapping, and other geospatial data to support intelligence analysis and decision-making. 
- It involves the collection, analysis, and visualization of information related to physical locations and features, such as buildings, terrain, and transportation infrastructure. 
- GEOINT is used by government agencies, military organizations, and private companies to gain insights into a wide range of issues, from national security to business operations.

# Ten important GEOINT techniques

- Remote Sensing: The use of satellites, aircraft, drones, and other sensors to collect imagery and other data from a distance.
- Imagery Analysis: The interpretation of visual data, including photos, videos, and maps, to identify objects, features, and patterns of interest.
- Terrain Analysis: The study of the physical characteristics of a landscape, including elevation, slope, and vegetation cover, to identify potential obstacles or threats.
- Geospatial Data Analysis: The use of software and algorithms to analyze and model geospatial data, such as population density, traffic patterns, and weather conditions.
- Cartography: The creation of maps and other visual representations of geospatial data to support analysis and decision-making.
- Geodetic Surveying: The use of surveying techniques to measure and map the Earth's surface, including the position and elevation of objects and features.
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS): The use of software and databases to store, manage, and analyze geospatial data, often in combination with other types of data.
- LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): The use of lasers to measure and map the Earth's surface, including terrain and vegetation.
- GPS (Global Positioning System): The use of satellites to determine the precise location of objects and features on the Earth's surface.
- Spatial Data Mining: The use of data mining techniques to identify patterns and trends in geospatial data, often used to support predictive modeling and decision-making.
